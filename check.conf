# units:
# available unit: ppm, ppb, mm, um, nm
# default unit: ppm for asym, um for diff
# parenthese is not supported yet



# variables:
#   - most of time, variables show have statistical type: mean or rms
#   - '+' sign makes the specified variable to be plotted, if no '+' sign, then 
#     the specified variables will be checked, but not be plotted unless
#     there is bad data (fail the cut) in it.
# cut: 
#   - currently, there are three kinds of cut: low cut, high cut, and stability cut
#   - stability cut: how many sigma can current value deviated from previous 
#     mean value, and the sigma value is the rms value of previous values.
#   - any cut can be omitted, but must be seperated by ';' even being empty
#
# single variable: 
#   - must specify statistical type
#   - cut: low, high, stability
